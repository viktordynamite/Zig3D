# Zig3D Engine

Welcome to **Zig3D** â€“ a personal project where I'm experimenting with the Zig programming language to develop a basic 3D engine. This project is a learning journey, and I'm excited to see where it takes me!

## Project Overview

This project is a simple 3D engine built from scratch using Zig. The goal is to explore and understand low-level programming, 3D mathematics, and rendering techniques. It's a playground for learning and experimenting, so expect to see frequent updates, refactoring, and possibly major changes as I learn and grow.

### Features

- **Basic 3D Math**: Vector and matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, dot/cross products, etc.)
- **Rendering**: Simple rendering logic to visualize 3D points and objects.
- **Engine Core**: Initialization, main loop handling, and basic structure for a 3D engine.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- [Zig Compiler](https://ziglang.org/download/) - Ensure you have the latest version installed.

#### Building the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zig3d.git
   cd zig3d

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    zig build

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    zig build run

### Project Structure

1. main.zig - The entry point of the program.
2. zig3d.zig - Core engine logic including initialization, main loop, and cleanup.
3. math.zig - Basic 3D mathematics (vectors, matrices, transformations).
4. render.zig - Rendering logic for drawing points, shapes, etc.
5. build.zig - Build script for the Zig build system.
